I fully hate looking for recipes.  
"Oh let me tell you a story about how my great grandmother died to preserve this recipe in the 
sacred scrolls of our family legacy, and how it then became a hit at my Sunday brunch. Oh and since you're here 
already here are 50 mid-content ads with 3 videos playing in the bottom corner."

## Pickled Radishes

### Ingredients 
- 2 bunches of radishes (like 6 or 7 radishes per bunch I think)
- 1/2 cup apple cider vinegar
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 cup water 
- Whatever freak spices you want to throw in. 
    - Pepper
    - Chili Powder
    - Etc. 

### Steps 
- Slice all radishes into wafers
- Boil water and sugar together until the sugar dissolves
- Add extra spices of your choosing
- Put radishes into container
- Pour vinegar into container
- Pour water/sugar/spice mix into container 
- Chill in fridge for like an hour 

### Notes 
- Other recipes say to include the vinegar with the water/sugar mix when boiling, but it is 100% not worth it.
  It'll make the entire place smell like rotting feet. 
  Like maybe if the goal is to have the stuff last for months, then you want to boil as much as possible to kill 
  bacteria, but if you're going through the stuff in the next week or whatever then don't bother. 
- The sugar is literally just to taste. You can have none or double the amount listed here, whatever floats boats. 
- I haven't *suuuper* noticed any benefit to waiting a long time before eating them, past the first hour or two.
