There are always strong feelings when leaving a place you have worked at. 
It doesn't matter the reason or the tenure, it 
is always a significant moment in your life.  
You hope the strong feelings are mostly positive, although we all know that 
cannot be the case every time. 

I find very bothersome, to feel anything at all about the event. 
It clashes with my ideal reality where work is 
something an individual is temporarily inconvenienced with. 
Why have feelings of any sort at all for a thing that is only begrudgingly 
tolerated in the first place? 

But it's more. It's a group of people and a shared vision.   
So the feelings remain.
