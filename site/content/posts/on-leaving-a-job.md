There are always strong feelings when leaving a place you have worked at. 
It doesn't matter the reason or the tenure, it 
is always a significant moment in your life.  
You hope the strong feelings are mostly positive, although we all know that 
cannot be the case every time. 

I find very bothersome, to feel anything at all about the event. 
It clashes with my default cynical view that work is 
something an individual is temporarily inconvenienced with. 
Why have feelings of any sort at all for a thing that is only begrudgingly 
tolerated in the first place? 

Thinking about it any amount beyond the superficial kind of invalidates that 
reasoning though. Collaborating with others to 
contribute to a shared vision is deeply meaningful, and 
at a longer view a job is a stepping stone on a long 
and winding path that you get to puff up and call a career, 
if you're lucky. 
So, despite a reflexive desire to ignore emotions when associated 
with a job, they remain.   
And I would say that despite the situation that ended the job, 
the final emotion tends to be positive that it has been done. 
Obviously there are exceptions to this, but on average. 

It is easy to imagine a change in jobs as a chance to pivot into a new 
definition of yourself. It's like moving to a new city and leaving everything behind. 
Nobody knows anything about you, except for 
what can be written down on a resume. You can change 
your interests, and refine your stated goals (or change them entirely). 

So, I look forward to the change. Thus concludes my winding justification 
for my most recent departure. 
To revisit this post next time around should be hilarious.
