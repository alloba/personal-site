A website meant to endlessly play little video clips in a random order.

The images are pulled from a publicly accessible bucket in S3,
which are populated by a simple script that scrapes image boards online

This project probably holds the record for the most used thing I have made in my personal time.
It's nice to just set it going on a monitor and have it as background noise.
