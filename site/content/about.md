# This Site
## Purpose
This site has gone through more iterations than I care to remember. 

It started out as a documentation/notes source, which was then converted into an 
actual website. Then the documentation was split out from the rest of the content, 
then a lot of it was cut, then it languished for a year or so... it's a whole thing. 

Currently, the site is vaguely defined as a center of my online presence. 
Notes, projects, links to other things, whatever. 

## Tech 
The site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),   
and makes use of the [Terminal](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-terminal) theme. 

The site is hosted in AWS, as an S3 bucket. It's fronted by a Cloudfront Distribution. 
No particular reason for the infrastructure selection 
except for it being familiar from the day job, while being dirt cheap for low-traffic
scenarios (which this site very much is).
