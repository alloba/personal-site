# This Site

This thing has gone through more iterations than I care to remember. 

It started out as a documentation/notes source that was kept locally, 
which was then converted into a hosted site. 
Then the documentation was split out from the rest of the content, 
then a lot of it was cut, 
and now it's just sitting gathering dust mainly.  


The site is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/),
and makes use of the [Stack](https://github.com/CaiJimmy/hugo-theme-stack) theme.
