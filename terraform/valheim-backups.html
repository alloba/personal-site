            <h1>OnlyFriends Valheim Server Backups</h1>
            <p>These are all the manual snapshots that were created for the group's mistlands playthrough.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>DO NOT EXPECT THIS TO BE HERE FOREVER.</b></p>
            <p>These files are going to be removed a couple of months after initial posting, on 04/01/2023 (April 1st).</p>
            <br>
            <p>Each zip file contains several discrete backups, since they were pulled as-is from the server. The filename indicates when they were originally grabbed off the server.</p>
            <p>Note that the server was not running in EST, so the internal timestamps differ slightly from what you would expect.</p>
            <p>Also excuse the fact that the first backup here doesn't match the folder structure of the later ones. It was all very in-the-moment.</p>
